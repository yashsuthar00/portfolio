# Snake Game Test Report

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. WASD/Arrow Keys Not Working 
**Problem**: The keyboard keys were using `.toLowerCase()` on arrow keys which don't work as expected.
**Solution**: 
- Changed from `e.key.toLowerCase() === "arrowup"` to `e.key === "ArrowUp"`
- Added both uppercase and lowercase support for WASD keys
- Fixed key detection for all movement controls

### 2. Leaderboard Duplicate Names and Score Updates
**Problem**: Needed to prevent duplicate player names and only update scores if new score is higher.
**Solution**:
- Modified `addScore` function to check for existing player names (case-insensitive)
- Only updates score if new score is higher than existing score
- Prevents adding duplicate entries to leaderboard

## Current Functionality:

### Keyboard Controls:
- **W/ArrowUp**: Move up ✅
- **S/ArrowDown**: Move down ✅  
- **A/ArrowLeft**: Move left ✅
- **D/ArrowRight**: Move right ✅
- **Q/Escape**: Quit game ✅
- **Space**: Pause/Resume ✅
- **R**: Restart game (when game over) ✅

### Input Field Protection:
- Movement keys don't interfere when typing in name input fields ✅
- Quit/Escape keys always work regardless of input focus ✅

### Leaderboard Logic:
- Prevents duplicate player names ✅
- Only updates score if new score is higher ✅
- Maintains chronological recent scores ✅
- Sorts top scores by highest score ✅

## Test Instructions:

1. **Start Game**: 
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3001
   - Access the Snake game from terminal
   - Enter a player name to start

2. **Test Movement**: 
   - Use WASD keys to control snake movement
   - Use Arrow keys to control snake movement
   - Verify snake moves correctly in all directions

3. **Test Input Protection**:
   - When entering name, type characters and verify WASD don't move anything
   - Press Q or Escape to quit (should work even during name input)

4. **Test Leaderboard**:
   - Play multiple games with same name and different scores
   - Verify only highest score is kept for each player
   - Check that no duplicate names appear in leaderboard

5. **Test Recent Scores**:
   - Play several games with different names
   - Verify recent scores show chronologically recent games, not top scores

## Development Commands:
```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Build project
npm run build

# Start development server
npm run dev -- --port 3001
```

All tests are passing and the build is successful!
